**Meshtastic Serbia** is an informal community of enthusiasts established to bring together all Meshtastic network users in Serbia and the wider region. Gathering and experience sharing take place through the publicly available Meshtastic channel as well as the community's active Telegram group.

The network is maintained and developed by a volunteer community — individuals who contribute out of enthusiasm, without financial compensation.

It is important to note that **Meshtastic Serbia is not officially affiliated with or endorsed by the [Meshtastic®](https://meshtastic.org) project**.
